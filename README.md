# python-api-challenge
This assignment has two main parts. WeatherPy is an analysis using the Open Weather API to show the relationship of factors like humidity, temperature, wind speed, etc. across a random set of cities, not limited by lat/long. It includes some linear regression analyses for the different factors. 

The next part, VacationPy, uses the data gathered in WeatherPy and filters it based on ideal weather conditions. It uses the GoogleAPI to find nearby hotels in these ideal cities and layers them on a heatmap that shows the high humidity areas.
